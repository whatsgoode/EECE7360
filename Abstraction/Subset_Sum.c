*
* \details     This module is intended to provide a generic framework for
*              processing an instance of a subset sum problem. The values and
*              best solution are tracked, along with a pointer to a solver
*              function that can be changed as needed.
*
*              Also included are some generic printing functions for reporting
*              data.
